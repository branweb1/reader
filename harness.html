      whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.
      ‘Come, it’s pleased so far,’ thought Alice, and she went on. ‘Would you
      tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?’

      ‘That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,’ said the Cat.

      ‘I don’t much care where--’ said Alice.

      ‘Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,’ said the Cat.

So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see
it trot away quietly into the wood. ‘If it had grown up,’ she said
to herself, ‘it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
rather a handsome pig, I think.’ And she began thinking over other
children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
to herself, ‘if one only knew the right way to change them--’ when she
was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a
tree a few yards off.
