      Alice was just beginning to think to herself, ‘Now, what am I to do with
      this creature when I get it home?’ when it grunted again, so violently,
      that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could
      be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she
      felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.

      So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see
      it trot away quietly into the wood. ‘If it had grown up,’ she said
      to herself, ‘it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
      rather a handsome pig, I think.’ And she began thinking over other
      children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
      to herself, ‘if one only knew the right way to change them--’ when she
      was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a
      tree a few yards off.

      The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she
      thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she
      felt that it ought to be treated with respect.

      ‘Cheshire Puss,’ she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
      whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.
      ‘Come, it’s pleased so far,’ thought Alice, and she went on. ‘Would you
      tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?’

      ‘That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,’ said the Cat.

      ‘I don’t much care where--’ said Alice.

      ‘Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,’ said the Cat.

    Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
    All mimsy were the borogoves,
    And the mome raths outgrabe.
    Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
    The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
    Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
    The frumious Bandersnatch!
